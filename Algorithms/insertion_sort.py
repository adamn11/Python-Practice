'''

Insertion Sort: An in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. Here, a 
    sub-list is maintained which is always sorted. The array is searched
    sequentially and unsorted items are moved and inserted into the sorted 
    sub-list (in the same array). Not suitable for large data sets.


Time Compmlexity (Best): O(n)
Time Complexity (Average and Worst): O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1s)

Implementation:
Insertion Sort
